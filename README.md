# Ibraheem R's p5 Template

A quick template for springboarding visual programming experiments. Includes a fullscreen canvas that resizes with the window.

I'll probably update this with things I use frequently.

Use it:

```
npx degit IbraheemR/p5template <project name>
```

Loads the latest version of p5 from jsdelivr.net - probably not safe for production.
